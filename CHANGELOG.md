### CI
- `ci.yml` now actually runs the unit tests: the job runs `lint → typecheck →
  test → build` (was build-only, so the Vitest suite never ran in CI).

### Changed
- `.gitignore`: explicitly ignore the compiled `vite.config.js` / `vite.config.d.ts`
  (stray `tsc -b` outputs) so they never get committed alongside `vite.config.ts`.

### Added
- Portal onboarding captures the parent name + an editable display name.
- Playground v2 desktop workspace: window / split layout, Monaco code editor,
  Phaser game runner, standalone chat pane, taskbar + desktop icons, error
  debugging (jump-to-error + Ask AI to fix), light/dark theme, and S3-backed
  editor files.

### Fixed
- Playground UX polish: Monaco hover/suggest tooltips no longer clipped, robust
  Phaser vendoring at build time, wider editor launch, chat keeps focus/history,
  smoother generating screen.
