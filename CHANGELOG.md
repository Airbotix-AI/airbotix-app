All notable changes to airbotix-app (Portal + Learn SPA) are recorded here.

## 2026-06-07

### Added
- Parent-portal first-login onboarding (`parent-portal-onboarding-prd.md`): a one-time,
  skippable 3-slide **WelcomeWizard** ("what Airbotix is / you're in control / 3 next steps")
  and a persistent, data-driven **GettingStartedCard** checklist on the Dashboard (log kid in →
  add Stars → optional spending limits), plus a **KidLoginHelper** modal showing the copyable
  family code + plain-language login steps. Frontend-only: completion derived from existing
  family/wallet/payment-methods/auto-topup queries + per-parent (`sub`-keyed) localStorage flags
  (`src/lib/onboardingStorage.ts`); pure logic in `onboardingState.ts` with Vitest coverage.
  Mounted in `DashboardPage` (parent-with-family branch only). Payment step is gentle / never
  blocking (D-ONB2-02).

### Changed
- `.gitignore`: explicitly ignore the compiled `vite.config.js` / `vite.config.d.ts`
  (stray `tsc -b` outputs) so they never get committed alongside `vite.config.ts`.

## 2026-06-06

### Added
- Portal onboarding captures the parent name + an editable display name.
- Playground v2 desktop workspace: window / split layout, Monaco code editor,
  Phaser game runner, standalone chat pane, taskbar + desktop icons, error
  debugging (jump-to-error + Ask AI to fix), light/dark theme, and S3-backed
  editor files.

### Fixed
- Playground UX polish: Monaco hover/suggest tooltips no longer clipped, robust
  Phaser vendoring at build time, wider editor launch, chat keeps focus/history,
  smoother generating screen.
