### CI
- `ci.yml` now actually runs the unit tests: the job runs `lint → typecheck →
  test → build` (was build-only, so the Vitest suite never ran in CI).

### Changed
- **Activity page (`/portal/audit`) now speaks plain language.** It previously dumped
  raw machine `event_type` strings (`wallet.topup_initiated`) and the full JSON payload
  (`pack_sku`, `payment_intent_id`, `amount_aud_cents`…) — unreadable for parents. Each
  event is now mapped to a friendly icon + headline + detail line (e.g. 💳 *Top-up started
  · 10 Stars · $10.00 AUD*) via a new `src/lib/auditCopy.ts` table covering wallet / LLM /
  approval / project / auth / class / safety / family / incident events, with a title-cased
  fallback so no unmapped event ever leaks a raw `dotted.snake_case` string. The raw
  `event_type` + JSON is preserved behind a collapsed **"Technical details"** disclosure
  for auditability. Actor labels are now parent-facing ("You" / "Your child" / "AI helper").
  Vitest coverage in `auditCopy.test.ts`. Step toward the richer §4.6 vision (session
  grouping / filters / export remain unbuilt).
- `.gitignore`: explicitly ignore the compiled `vite.config.js` / `vite.config.d.ts`
  (stray `tsc -b` outputs) so they never get committed alongside `vite.config.ts`.

### Added
- Portal onboarding captures the parent name + an editable display name.
- Playground v2 desktop workspace: window / split layout, Monaco code editor,
  Phaser game runner, standalone chat pane, taskbar + desktop icons, error
  debugging (jump-to-error + Ask AI to fix), light/dark theme, and S3-backed
  editor files.

### Fixed
- Playground UX polish: Monaco hover/suggest tooltips no longer clipped, robust
  Phaser vendoring at build time, wider editor launch, chat keeps focus/history,
  smoother generating screen.
